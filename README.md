### Hi there! I'm Andy

I am a student at the University of Pennsylvania in the Jerome Fisher Program in Management & Technology, pursuing a BSE in Computer Science and a BS in Economics from The Wharton School. My interests include process optimization, UI/UX design, user research, and neural networks.

I am currently a Software Engineering Intern at DoorDash, an incoming Software Engineering Intern at Snap Inc, and Team Lead & Software Engineer at [Penn Labs](https://github.com/pennlabs). In the past, I developed IOS apps and react-based websites and worked on projects related to neural networks and robotics.  In my free time, I love to run, learn new things, and explore new places.
